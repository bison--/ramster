It just fills up your ram.
I decided to use mebibyte (MiB).

# Parameters:
# (without a Parameter, the Program does NOTHING!)
ramster [size in MiB] [[malloc] [forever]]

# Fills up 512MiB and locks it, till the program is closed
./ramster 512

# To use the c method "malloc" use
./ramster 512 malloc

# Fills your ram FOREVER! Should "freeze" your system, needs reset after that!
./ramster forever

# Here the simplest code-version that "fills" your ram isntantly and fast as Hell
# compile it on your own :P
while(true)
{ int *lock = new int; }
